## What is commentarius?
The name commentarius comes from the Latin word for "journal." We think that implementing a journal/blog should be as simple as possible, without the need for databases or dynamic pages.

That is why we have decided to create commentarius, which does not require databases or code execution by the server, all the processing is done by the client, we simply use html, js and css.

## Installation
The deployment of commentarius will only take you two minutes and is one of the simplest thing you can do:

The first step is to download this github repository

Once we have the repository downloaded, we open it and go to the */www* folder

After opening this folder, we will upload it to our web hosting or server.

Now, we can check that our blog is online and functional.

Finally, we can modify the pages to give our touch to the blog.

When you want to upload a post you just have to design it in markdown and upload it to the posts folder (Remember that the title of the file will be the title of the post).
